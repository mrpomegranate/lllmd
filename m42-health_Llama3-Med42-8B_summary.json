Advise cessation of non-prescribed Adderall use until cleared by healthcare provider.\n4. Educate patient regarding potential risks associated with illicit drug use and misuse of prescription medications.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointment to review results and discuss next steps.\r\n6. Recommend lifestyle modifications focusing on stress management techniques and maintaining healthy habits.\nDemographics: Male, Age 17\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nThe patient reports experiencing palpitations for approximately three months. He describes these episodes as occurring randomly throughout the day, lasting several minutes, and associated with retrosternal pressure-like discomfort and lightheadedness without loss of consciousness or falling.

Further evaluation by a cardiologist might be warranted considering the persistent nature of palpitations despite absence of typical cardiac symptomatology.\nDemographics: Male, aged 17 years\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nThe patient reports experiencing intermittent palpitations over the past 3-4 months, described as feeling like his heart beats \u201cout of his chest\u201d accompanied by brief dyspnea.

Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Respiratory exam clear to auscultation bilaterally. Neurological assessment intact, with no focal deficits observed.\n\nDiagnostics:\nPending further investigation due to incomplete data provided. Possible considerations include arrhythmias, thyrotoxicosis given family history, stimulant-induced cardiac effects from non-prescribed Adderall use, or anxiety-related symptoms.\n\nPlan:\n1) Obtain detailed electrocardiogram (ECG).\n2) Perform echocardiography to assess structural heart function.\n3) Thyroid function test (TFT) considering maternal thyroid disorder influence.\n4) Urine drug screen to confirm absence of illicit drugs.\n5) Consider referral to cardiology for comprehensive evaluation based on initial diagnostic results.\n6) Advise cessation of nonprescription Adderall intake until further notice.\n7) Schedule follow-up appointment after diagnostics are completed to review findings and adjust treatment plan accordingly.\nDemographics: 17-year-old male\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\n- Reports experiencing palpitations lasting approximately 3-4 minutes over the past three months, occurring five to six times.
